# R_Analysis


AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles. There are a number of issues surrounding the vehicle’s specifications and manufacturing process that are blocking the manufacturing team from proceeding.To help analyze the production data in order to justify some last-minute design decisions.The launch of the MechaCar should be one of the most successful product launches.


# Objectives:


The goals of this challenge:



*  Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.

*  Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.


*  Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.


*   Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.



#  Instructions:

### (1)MPG Regression:


*  Using multiple linear regression, design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using a number of variables within the MechaCar mpg dataset. Create a separate text file called MechaCarWriteUp.txt. In the text file, provide a small writeup of your interpretation of the multiple linear regression results. Be sure to include the following details:


Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?


Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?




### (2)Suspension Coil Summary:

*  Using the same MechaCarWriteUp.txt text file, provide a short write-up of your interpretation and findings for the suspension coil summary statistics. Be sure to include the following details:


The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?



### (3) Suspension Coil T-Test:

*  Using the same suspension coil data and the MechaCarChallenge.RScript file, determine if the suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. (Hint: Refer to the t-test section of this module to determine which statistical test to use.)


*  In the MechaCarWriteUp.txt text file, provide a small writeup of your interpretation and findings for the t-test results.



### (4) Design Your Own Study:



write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar outperforms the competition. In your study design, be sure to write about the following considerations:

*  Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).


*  Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.


* Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?
